### Task: Create a custom Apache user

In response to heightened security concerns, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. The outlined specifications for creating a custom Apache user are as follows:

#### a. Create a user named `jim` on App server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.
  
#### b. Assign a unique `UID 1327` and designate the home directory as `/var/www/jim`.

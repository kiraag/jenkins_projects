### Task: Create a custom Apache user

In response to heightened security concerns, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted for custom Apache users for their web applications. Each user is tailored specifically for an application, enhancing security measures. The outlined specifications for creating a custom Apache user are as follows:

#### a. Create a user named `jim` on App server 2 within the Stratos Datacenter.
  
#### b. Assign a unique `UID 1327` and designate the home directory as `/var/www/jim`.

### Steps to Create a Custom Apache User

To create a custom Apache user named `jim` with the specified `UID` and home directory on **App Server 2**, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Access the App Server 2
Use SSH to log in to **App Server 2** in the Stratos Datacenter.

#### Step 2: Create the user `jim` with UID 1327 and home directory `/var/www/jim`
Run the following command to create the user with a specific UID and home directory:

```bash
sudo useradd -u 1327 -d /var/www/jim -m jim

### Explanation:
- `sudo`: Run the command with superuser privileges.

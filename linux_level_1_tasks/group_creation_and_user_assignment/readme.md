Before adding `kano` to the group, check if the user exists. If not, create the user.

use `sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep kano` to check the user existance
use `sudo useradd kano` to create the user

### 3. Add User to Group:
Now, add the user `kano` to the `nautilus_admin_users` group.

`sudo usermod -aG nautilus_admin_users kano`

check the creation of group & user with `sudo cat /etc/group`
